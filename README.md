# dsa-project

In this term project, I will analyze how daily technology usage, including social media and screen time, impacts mental health indicators such as stress, sleep quality, and productivity. Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset captures behavioral patterns and their correlations with mental wellness. The goal is to understand the link between digital habits and mental well-being, promoting better mental health through effective screen time management. Excessive screen time and frequent social media use are expected to significantly affect stress levels and sleep quality, ultimately reducing productivity. This analysis will help identify trends for research and predictive modeling on the impact of technology on mental health.
