# DSA210-Project

## **Project Proposal**
In this term project, I will analyze how daily technology use, including social media and screen time, affects mental health indicators like stress, sleep quality, and productivity. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to explore the link between digital habits and mental well-being, promoting healthier screen time management. Excessive screen time and frequent social media use are expected to increase stress and decrease sleep quality, reducing productivity. The analysis will help identify trends for further research and predictive modeling on technology’s impact on mental health.

## **Motivation**
With increasing technology use, particularly social media and screen time, understanding its impact on mental health is crucial. By analyzing the Kaggle dataset, I aim to:

- Explore how technology use affects stress, sleep, and productivity.
- Identify trends in mental well-being across usage patterns.
- Provide insights into how screen time management can improve mental health.

## **Data Set and Processing**
1) **Data Set**
The dataset includes data points that track an individual's daily use of technology and mental health factors. The following items are included:

- **User_ID**: A unique identifier for each participant.
- **Age**: The age of the participant.
- **Daily_Screen_Time (hours)** : Average daily screen time in hours.
- **Mental_Health_Score (1-10)**: Self-reported mental health score, where 1 is poor, and 10 is excellent.
- **Stress_Level (1-10)**: Self-reported stress level, where 1 is very low, and 10 is very high.
- **Sleep_Quality (1-10)**: Self-reported sleep quality score.

## **Conclusion**
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

- How does daily technology use affect stress, sleep, and productivity?
- What patterns in technology usage are linked to mental health outcomes?
- Can screen time management improve well-being and productivity?
This project isn’t just about data analysis; it’s about using insights to promote healthier digital habits and better mental health.
